With this repository, we give SAP partners guidance on how to extend SAP ERP solutions with side-by-side cloud applications running on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). It includes:
- a preselection of SAP BTP components with architecture guidance tailored to meet the cost requirements of small and midsize enterprises (SME), 
- best practices (golden path) to build, deploy, and provision full-stack SAP BTP applications, and
- information on the interoperability and integration with cloud ERP solutions such as SAP Business ByDesign and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.

The repository includes a sample application that is ready to be deployed and run, and tutorials to rebuild it from scratch following an incremental development approach from one-off to multi-consumer solutions.

### About the Sample Application *Poetry Slam Manager*

Imagine you're an event manager, for example, Peter, and your job is to organize and host poetry slams. 

As your company runs its business on a cloud ERP system provided by SAP, you use its project management component to plan and staff events, to collect costs, and to purchase equipment.
Additionally, an SAP partner provided you with a side-by-side application called Poetry Slam Manager (PSM) to publish poetry slam events and to register visitors and artists such as Julie.

</p>

For security and compliance reasons, it's crucial to you that event publishing and visitor registration are clearly separated from your ERP system. Nevertheless, as a power user working in both systems, you asked the partner to ensure a seamless user experience and navigation between the SAP system and Poetry Slam Manager.

The sample showcases how a side-by-side application benefits from using SAP BTP. The qualities relevant for enterprise-grade partner applications, supported by SAP BTP services and programming models, include:

- Synchronize the status of the poetry slam with the status of the associated project.
- Make use of a standardized online development environment using SAP Business Application Studio.
- Use a state-of-the-art web application architecture based on HTML5, Node.js, and SAP HANA Cloud.

## Requirements

The application is based on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and SAP ERP solutions. Therefore, here's what you need:

- An SAP BTP Test, Demo, Development (TDD) account, which includes SAP Business Application Studio as a standardized development environment,  
- GitHub as your code repository, and 
- an SAP ERP system.

To get a more detailed list of the required entitlements and the proposed structure of subaccounts for the deployed Partner Reference Application, go to the [Bill of Materials](./Tutorials/01-BillOfMaterials.md).

## Overview

This repository explains the development journey along the path from
1. development of the core application as a single-customer ("one-off") deployment,
2. enhancement to a multi-customer ("multi-tenant") solution,
3. integration with different ERP back ends,
4. extension with additional features.

A complete and working implementation of the above steps is available in separate branches:
1. One-off deployment: branch [*main-single-tenant*](../../tree/main-single-tenant)
2. Multi-tenant deployment and ERP integration: branch [*main-multi-tenant*](../../tree/main-multi-tenant)
3. Additional features (based on the multi-tenant implementation): branch [*main-multi-tenant-features*](../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features)

This allows you to check out those branches and directly work with the respective implementation. You can use GitHub comparisons to understand the changes required along the development journey.

The tutorials are provided in the ([*main*](../../)) branch.

Updates to this repository are documented in the [change history](./Tutorials/99-Change-History.md).
